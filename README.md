Briefly explained in video.


Which algorithm you got better accuracy? Can you justify why?


->Model accuracy depends on many factors.  Data quality and hyperparameter selection. You can compare the accuracy of the two models by comparing the accuracy evaluation   and classification report.
-> In general, Naive Bayes is a fast, simple algorithm that works well for high-dimensional data. It is based on Bayes' theorem, which assumes independence between          features. 
->his is often a strong assumption in real data. SVM, on the other hand, is a more powerful and flexible algorithm that works well with linear and nonlinear data. It       tries to find the hyperplane with the largest margin separating the classes and can be adjusted to avoid overfitting.

->The choice of algorithm therefore depends on the nature of the specific problem and data.
